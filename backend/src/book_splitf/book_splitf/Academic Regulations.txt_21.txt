However, if the mark range for F grade of that class is <50 (based on mean- 2*sigma), then that value 
is used to check the Grand total marks requirement instead of 50 for awarding letter grades. If a 
course does not have an “S” grade (or) if the “S” grade boundary exceeds 100 as per the above 
formula, the maximum of 3 or top 5% students of the class grading strength will be awarded “S” 
grade. Before calculating the class average and standard deviation, the grand total marks obtained 
by the student is “rounded-up” to the next integer (any fraction will move to the next integer) and 
the same is displayed also. Marks of other evaluation components are not altered and stored up to 
two decimal accuracy. This total is used to compare the grade band minimum and maximum limits 
that are calculated and displayed as “rounded-off” integer (fraction of 0.5 and above will be 
converted to the next integer and less than 0.5 will be truncated). 
All the conditions stipulated in Section 9.4 for the Pass/Fail are applicable to relative grading also. 
While applying relative grading, if the minimum marks corresponding to ‘E’ grade happens to be less 
than 50, then that mark will be set as the minimum mark required to pass the course. Similarly, 
when the class average is high, marks above 50 may result in ‘F’ grade. Under such circumstances, 
the student will be awarded ‘E’ grade and declared pass. If the minimum of the grade band is less 
than 100% but the maximum has exceeded 100%, then the maximum of the grade band shall be 
reset to 100%. But, if the minimum of the grade band exceeds 100%, it indicates that the specific 
letter grade or better letter grade(s) cannot be issued to that class. 
If the class strength is less than or equal to 10 in a theory or lab embedded theory course absolute
grading shall be adopted instead of the class-wise relative grading. All the Laboratory, soft skills, 
extracurricular, non-graded core requirement (NGCR) courses and project courses shall adopt 
absolute grading method only, irrespective of the class strength as shown in Table-6.
Table-6: Absolute Grading – Letter Grade and its range
Letter Grade Marks range (max. of 100)
S >= 90
A >= 80 but < 90
B >= 70 but < 80
C >= 60 but < 70
D >= 55 but < 60
E >= 50 but < 55
F < 50
9.6 Evaluation for Laboratory only Courses
A few skill based courses may have only laboratory component without a theory and/ or tutorial 
component. To make students attend lab classes without fail and to increase the importance given 
to the lab classes, the practical component will be evaluated based on the performance of the 
students in each experiment. Students who do not earn a minimum of 50% marks (average of the 
marks awarded for all the exercises of the course) are declared as ‘Fail’ in the lab component with 
an ‘N’ grade and they have to re-register the lab only course/or lab component of a course. As in the 
case of Theory courses, laboratory courses will also have a Final Assessment Test. The weightage for 
the continuous assessment will be 60% and for the Final Assessment will be 40%. All soft skill courses
