There is no provision for re-evaluation in case of Lab/ Practical exams, Soft Skills, Student Project viva 
voce exam or Seminar/ Design/ Mini-project courses or a component of exam of type ‘project’ and 
also for comprehensive examination. The final grades awarded to each subject will be announced by 
the University and the same will be made available to students as well as the parents. In courses 
where the class average is 90% and above, the FAT answer papers will be re-evaluated by another

for the high class average.
9.10 Calculation of Grade Point Average
The Grade Point Average (GPA) earned by a student is a quantitative indication of his/her 
performance in a semester. GPA is the weighted average of the grade points obtained in all the 
courses registered (after add/drop/ withdrawal) by the student during the semester. For each course 
registered, the grade points earned is multiplied by the credits for that course. The sum of all such 
grade point-credits product is divided by the total credits registered in that semester to get the GPA 
of that semester.
The Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA), which indicates the overall performance of a student 
from the time he/she joined the University to a specific semester, is obtained by calculating the 
weighted average of the grade points obtained in all the courses registered by the student since the 
first semester. Both GPA and CGPA are calculated as follows at the end of every semester and 
indicated in the Grade Sheet. 
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 = 
∑𝑖𝑖(𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖 ∗ 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺)
∑ 𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
where, Ci is the number of credits for i
th course, and GP is the grade points earned for that course. i 
includes all the courses registered in all semesters including those in which the student has an ‘F’ 
grade. If a student had failed more than once in a course or substituted a course, the credits will appear 
only once, both in the numerator and denominator. Pass-Fail (‘P’ grade), audit courses and courses 
taken towards ‘Minor’ or ‘Honours’ are not counted for the calculation of GPA or CGPA of the 
programme. The Consolidated Grade Sheet or Degree Certificate will not mention any ‘class’ or 
whatsoever, except the CGPA. GPA/ CGPA will be indicated by rounding-up the actual values to two 
decimal places.
% equivalent of CGPA = CGPA * 10
For example, a CGPA of 8.75 is considered equivalent to 87.5% (CGPA of 8.75 x 10 = 87.5%). 
Controller of Examinations will issue necessary certificates to students who request for CGPA to 
percentage equivalence of marks.
